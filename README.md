<h2>Description</h2>

This project revolves around setting up a comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment Lab with a particular focus on Windows-based systems. It begins by preparing the environment, including the installation of virtualization software and Nessus Essentials. The Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM) setup involves configuring essential settings within the VM, enabling remote access, and conducting multiple Nessus scans with and without credentials to identify vulnerabilities. The project aims to simulate real-world scenarios by assessing the security posture of Windows 10 and XP VMs, providing a practical platform for vulnerability identification and assessment, ultimately enhancing network security and risk management.

<h2>Section 1: Preparation</h2> 

**Download Virtualization Software:**
  - Download either VirtualBox or VMware Workstation Player from the respective official websites.
  - Install the chosen virtualization software on your host machine.

**Download Windows 10 ISO:**
  - Go to the official Microsoft website and download the Windows 10 ISO file.
  - Save it to your local disk, typically in the C:\ISOs directory.
	**Download Nessus Essentials:**
  - Visit Tenable's website and download Nessus Essentials.
  - Ensure you have received an activation code for Nessus, usually sent to your email.

**Install Nessus Essentials:**
  - Execute the Nessus Essentials installer.
  - During installation, configure necessary settings.
  - Access Nessus through your web browser using the URL provided during installation (typically http://localhost:8834/WelcomeToNessus-Install/welcome).
  - Log in using your designated username and password.

<h2>Section 2: Windows 10 Virtual Machine Setup</h2> 

**Create Windows 10 VM:**
  - Open your virtualization software (VirtualBox or VMware).
  - Create a new virtual machine.
  - Choose Windows 10 as the guest operating system.
  - Configure the VM with a bridged network interface to allow network communication.
  - Set the virtual machine username as 'admin' and password as 'Password1'.

**Configuration Settings:**
- Within the Windows 10 VM:
  - Enable Remote Registry to allow remote access to the Windows Registry.
  - Enable Printer and File Sharing for sharing resources over the network.
  - Disable the Firewall to ensure it doesn't interfere with network scanning.
  - Disable User Account Control (UAC) by following the instructions provided here.

**Install Deprecated Firefox:**
  - Download an older version of Mozilla Firefox from the Mozilla FTP server.
  - Install this older version within the Windows 10 VM.

**Nessus Scans:**
  - Initiate an initial Nessus scan without inserting credentials to identify vulnerabilities.
  - Conduct a Nessus scan with inserted credentials (username/password) to uncover additional vulnerabilities.
  - After completing scans, uninstall the previously installed deprecated Firefox.

**Rescan Windows 10 VM:**
  - Run another Nessus scan on the Windows 10 VM to observe any changes in the vulnerability report.

<h2>Section 3: Windows XP Virtual Machine Setup</h2> 

**Create Windows XP VM:**
  - Use your virtualization software to create a new virtual machine.
  - Select Windows XP as the guest operating system.
  - Configure the VM with a bridged network interface for network connectivity.

**Security Policy Configuration:**
  - Access the security policies within the Windows XP VM.
  - Configure these policies according to Nessus requirements, which are typically documented in Nessus documentation or guides.

**Network Sharing:**
  - Set up network sharing on the Windows XP VM to enable communication with the host machine and other networked devices.

**Nessus Scan:**
  - Run a Nessus scan on the Windows XP VM, this time providing necessary credentials for the scan.
Examine the vulnerability report generated by Nessus.
